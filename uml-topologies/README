Topologies for uml-test

Contact dang@fprintf.net with questions/comments/ideas.

Requirements for the image for these tests:

- In a gentoo image:
  - A directory /var/umlstate
  - Move /etc/runlevels/default to /var/umlstate
	- /var/umlstate/default should have anything you want the image to boot
	  with in the absence of a test being run
  - Symlink /var/umlstate/default to /etc/runlevels/
  - Move /etc/conf.d to /var/umlstate
	- /var/umlstate/conf.d should have default configuration for the image for booting
	  without a test
  - Symlink /var/umlstate/conf.d to /etc/
  - Move /etc/init.d to /var/umlstate
	- /var/umlstate/init.d should have default init scripts for the image for booting
	  without a test
  - Symlink /var/umlstate/init.d to /etc/
  - Add this line to /etc/fstab:
	none        /var/umlstate   hostfs  defaults            0 0
  - If you want hostname setting to work correctly, you'll need to modify checkroot to
    mount /var/umlstate right after it remount / rw.  If you don't care about that, then
    it's okay, as filesystems get mounted right after hostname and kernel modules.

That's it.  With such an image, you can run arbitrary topologies via uml-test and a
topology.conf file.
