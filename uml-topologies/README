Topologies for uml-test

Contact dang@fprintf.net with questions/comments/ideas.

Requirements for the image for these tests:

- Gentoo image
- A directory /var/umlstate
- Move /etc/runlevels/default to /var/umlstate
	- /var/umlstate/default should have anything you want the image to boot with in the
	  absence of a test being run
- Symlink /var/umlstate/default to /etc/runlevels/
- Move /etc/conf.d to /var/umlstate
	- /var/umlstate/conf.d should have default configuration for the image for booting
	  without a test
- Symlink /var/umlstate/conf.d to /etc/
- Add this line to /etc/fstab:
	none        /var/umlstate   hostfs  defaults            0 0

That's it.  With such an image, you can run arbitrary topologies via uml-test and a
topology.conf file.
