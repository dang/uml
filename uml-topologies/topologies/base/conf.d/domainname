# When setting up resolv.conf, what should take precedence?
#  0 = let dhcp/whatever override DNSDOMAIN
#  1 = override dhcp/whatever with DNSDOMAIN

OVERRIDE=1

# To have a proper FQDN, you need to setup /etc/hosts and /etc/resolv.conf
# (domain entry in /etc/resolv.conf and FQDN in /etc/hosts).
#
# DNSDOMAIN merely sets the domain entry in /etc/resolv.conf, see 
# the resolv.conf(5) manpage for more info.
